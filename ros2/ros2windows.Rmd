# How to set environment in Windows 10

It's highly recommended to follow this page even you have already download some components, because there will be some extra setting for those software to cooperate together.

## Docker Desktop

[Download Here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

There are some points need to be mention:

### 1 Set Firewall rules

Docker Desktop will use WSL as Linux kernel, so we need to create TCP link between local machine and WSL.

1.  Search `firewall` in start menu and open `Windows Defender with Advanced Security`

2.  In the top left, click `Inbound rules`

3.  In the top right, click `New Rule`

4.  In the new page, select `Port` and then `Next`

5.  keep `TCP` and choose `Specific local ports` , set number `6000` . This is the specific port for WSL

6.  Go `Next` until last page.

7.  Setting Name of this rule in this page.

8.  Finish

### 2 Update WSL kernel

The auto-installed WSL may be out-of-dated.

## VS Code

[Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

We need to set Docker for vs code:

1.  open VS code, see the `tool bar` located in the left side.

2.  type `Docker` in the search bar

3.  Download first one (marked by Microsoft)

1.  Open `XLaunch`
